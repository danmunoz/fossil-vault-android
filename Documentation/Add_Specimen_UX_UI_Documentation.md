## User Interface Design Patterns

### Visual Organization

**Section-Based Layout:**
- Each major data category is grouped into visually distinct sections
- Sections use consistent iconography and color coding for instant recognition
- Progressive disclosure prevents cognitive overload by organizing related fields

**Section Identifiers:**
- Photos: Camera icon (Blue accent)
- Basic Info: Leaf icon (Green accent) 
- Location: Map pin icon (Orange accent)
- Dimensions: Ruler icon (Purple accent)
- Value: Dollar sign icon (Purple accent)
- Additional: Document icon (Gray accent)

### Input Field Design

**Text Input Patterns:**
- Consistent field styling with rounded corners and subtle borders
- Clear labels with required field indicators (red asterisk)
- Placeholder text provides contextual examples
- Focus states with color-coded borders

**Validation Visual Feedback:**
- Error states: Red border with error message below field
- Success states: Subtle green accent (implied through absence of error)
- Real-time validation for immediate feedback
- Error messages use clear, actionable language

**Specialized Input Types:**

1. **Selection Fields** (Period, Element):
   - Navigate to dedicated selection screens
   - Display current selection with chevron indicator
   - Support for custom "Other" option with text input

2. **Numeric Fields** (Dimensions, Prices):
   - Decimal keyboard for numeric entry
   - Localized number formatting support
   - Unit selectors adjacent to measurement fields

3. **Currency Fields**:
   - Dropdown currency selector with symbols
   - Decimal input for monetary values
   - Default currency from user preferences

4. **Location Picker**:
   - Interactive map interface in modal presentation
   - Search functionality for location discovery
   - GPS coordinate display and editing
   - Current location button for convenience

5. **Date Pickers**:
   - Native date selection interface
   - Separate collection and acquisition dates
   - Optional fields with clear empty states

6. **Photo Management**:
   - Grid-based photo collection interface
   - Camera and photo library integration
   - Multiple photo support with reordering capability

### Navigation & Actions

**Header Navigation:**
- Modal presentation with Cancel/Save actions
- Dynamic title: "Add New Specimen" vs "Edit Fossil"
- Save button styled as primary action with visual prominence

**Form Navigation:**
- Vertical scrolling through sections
- Automatic scroll-to-error on validation failure
- Focus management for keyboard navigation
- Tap-to-dismiss keyboard on scroll view interaction

## User Experience Flow

### Entry Points

1. **Primary Add Flow**: Main navigation "+" button
2. **Edit Flow**: Specimen detail view edit action
3. **Quick Add**: Potential voice or camera-first entry (future consideration)

### Form Completion Strategy

**Progressive Completion:**
- Required fields clearly marked with visual indicators
- Form validation occurs on save attempt, not during input
- Users can save partial data and return later (draft state)
- Smart defaults reduce initial cognitive load

**Validation Approach:**
- Client-side validation for immediate feedback
- Batch validation on save with scroll-to-first-error
- Error messages provide specific, actionable guidance
- Field-level validation for complex inputs (custom elements)

**Save Behavior:**
- Single save action for entire form
- Loading state during save operation with progress indicator
- Success confirmed through dismissal and return to collection
- Edit mode includes confirmation dialog for destructive updates

### Error Handling Patterns

**Field-Level Errors:**
- Inline error messages below affected fields
- Red border treatment for visual error identification
- Specific error text: "Please enter the species name"
- Error state persists until field is corrected

**Form-Level Validation:**
- Comprehensive validation on save attempt
- Scroll to first invalid field with focus management
- Multiple error handling without overwhelming the user
- Clear path to resolution for each error type

**Network/System Errors:**
- Loading states during save operations
- Graceful failure handling with retry options
- Offline support considerations for draft data
- Clear communication of system status

## Design System Application

### Typography Hierarchy

**Form Labels:** Medium weight, 14pt - Clear field identification
**Input Text:** Regular weight, 16pt - Optimal reading and input experience  
**Error Messages:** Regular weight, 12pt - Subtle but noticeable error communication
**Section Headers:** Semibold weight, 16pt - Clear content organization
**Helper Text:** Regular weight, 12pt - Contextual guidance

### Color Strategy

**Semantic Color Usage:**
- Error states: Red (#FF3B30) for validation and destructive actions
- Success states: Green (#34C759) for confirmation and positive feedback  
- Primary actions: Blue gradient for save operations
- Section accents: Varied colors for content categorization
- Neutral grays: Text hierarchy and interface structure

**Accessibility Considerations:**
- WCAG AA contrast ratios for all text combinations
- Color-blind friendly error indication (not color-only)
- Sufficient touch targets (44pt minimum)
- Focus indicators for keyboard navigation

### Component Consistency

**Reusable Components:**
- ValidatedTextField: Consistent input styling with error states
- Section containers: Uniform spacing and visual treatment
