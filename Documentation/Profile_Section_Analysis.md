# Profile Section Analysis - FossilVault Settings

## Overview

The Profile section is a comprehensive user management interface within the FossilVault Settings screen, providing account management, profile customization, and subscription handling. This section serves as the primary entry point for users to manage their personal information and account settings.

## Architecture Pattern

The Profile section follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **Models**: `UserProfile` struct containing user data
- **Views**: SwiftUI-based UI components (`ProfileView`, `EditProfileView`)
- **ViewModels**: Observable classes handling business logic (`ProfileViewModel`, `EditProfileViewModel`)
- **Data Layer**: `DataProvider` and `AuthenticationManager` for data access and authentication

## Entry Point - Settings Integration

### Location in Settings
The Profile section is accessed from the main Settings screen (`SettingsView.swift`) through the `accountSection` which contains:

```swift
NavigationLink {
    ProfileView(...)
} label: {
    profile
}
```

### Profile Preview in Settings
The Settings screen displays a condensed profile preview (lines 140-183 in `SettingsView.swift`):

**Visual Elements:**
- **Profile Photo**: 50x50 circular image
  - If user has profile picture: Displays using Kingfisher image loading
  - If no picture: Shows system person icon with gradient styling
- **User Information Display**:
  - **Authenticated Users**: Username/email + "Account, Subscriptions, and more" subtitle
  - **Anonymous Users**: "Anonymous user" + "Not signed in" subtitle

**Authentication State Handling:**
- Different displays based on `AuthenticationState` (.authenticated, .localUser, default)
- Conditional button display for account creation vs. profile access

## Main Profile View (ProfileView.swift)

### UI Structure

The Profile view is organized as a vertical list with distinct sections:

1. **Header Section** (headerSection - lines 67-80)
2. **Action Cards** (lines 36-40)
3. **Account Management Buttons** (lines 42-47)

### Header Section Design

**Profile Photo Display:**
- Large circular image (100x100 pixels)
- Interactive button allowing photo selection
- Uses Kingfisher for network image loading with placeholder
- Fallback to system person icon for users without photos

**User Information:**
- **Primary Text**: Username or "Fossil Enthusiast" fallback
- **Secondary Text**: User email address
- Typography follows `DesignSystem.Typography` standards

### Action Cards

Three main navigation cards with consistent design pattern:

#### 1. Edit Profile Card (lines 103-119)
- **Icon**: Pencil symbol in blue color
- **Label**: "Edit Profile"
- **Functionality**: NavigationLink to EditProfileView
- **Access Control**: Disabled for anonymous users (localUser state)

#### 2. Subscription Card (lines 121-147)
- **Dynamic Icon**: Crown (PRO) or Leaf (FREE) with appropriate colors
- **Label**: "Subscription" with status badge
- **Status Badge**: Displays "PRO" or "FREE" with visual styling
- **Navigation**: Links to SubscriptionStatus view
- **Access Control**: Disabled for anonymous users

#### 3. Display Shelf Card (lines 149-165)
- **Icon**: Photo stack symbol in blue
- **Label**: "My Display Shelf"
- **Navigation**: Links to DisplayShelfView
- **Access Control**: Disabled for anonymous users

### Account Management

**For Anonymous Users (localUser state):**
- **Create Account Button**: Primary styled button with person icon
- **Delete Account Button**: Red destructive styling

**For Authenticated Users:**
- **Sign Out Button**: Red destructive styling with confirmation flow

### Sheet Presentations

Three modal presentations handled via `PresentedSheet` enum:
1. **Authentication Flow**: Account creation/sign-up
2. **Sign Out Confirmation**: Different messages for authenticated vs anonymous users
3. **Local Account Deletion**: Specific handling for anonymous account removal

## Edit Profile View (EditProfileView.swift)

### Navigation Structure
- **Title**: "Edit Profile"
- **Save Button**: Toolbar placement, disabled when no changes or loading

- PhotosPicker integration for image selection
- Shadow styling for visual depth

**Form Fields Section (lines 157-201):**
- **Name Field**: Full name input
- **Location Field**: City/country input  
- **Bio Field**: Biography/description input
- Uses `ValidatedTextField` components with focus state management
- Organized under "Profile Information" section with icon styling

### State Management Features

- Sets up reactive bindings for form fields

**Save Process:**
- Validates changes exist before allowing save
- Updates UserProfile model with form data
- Handles image upload process
- Updates original profile reference after successful save
- Provides user feedback through alerts

## Data Models

### UserProfile Structure (UserProfile.swift)
```swift
struct UserProfile: Codable, Equatable {
    var userId: String
    var email: String
    var fullName: String?
    var username: String?
    var location: String?
    var bio: String?
    var isPublic: Bool
    var picture: StoredImage?
    var settings: AppSettings
}
```

**Key Properties:**
- **userId**: Unique identifier
- **email**: Primary email address (required)
- **fullName**: User's full name (optional)
- **username**: Display name (optional)
- **location**: Geographic location (optional)
- **bio**: Personal biography (optional)
- **isPublic**: Privacy setting flag
- **picture**: Profile image with StoredImage wrapper
- **settings**: Embedded app configuration settings

## Authentication Integration

### Authentication States
The profile section responds to three authentication states:

1. **`.authenticated`**: Full access to all profile features
2. **`.localUser`**: Anonymous account with limited access
3. **Default/Unauthenticated**: Basic state handling

### Access Control Pattern
Consistent pattern throughout profile section:
```swift
.disabled(authenticationManager.authenticationState == .localUser)
```

**Anonymous User Limitations:**
- Cannot edit profile information
- Cannot access subscription management
- Cannot use display shelf features
- Prompted to create account for full access

### Sign Out/Account Deletion Flow

**Confirmation Sheet (SignOutConfirmationSheet.swift):**
- Context-aware messaging (sign out vs. delete account)
- Warning about data loss for anonymous accounts
- Visual warning with triangle exclamation icon
- Destructive action styling with red coloring

**Different Behaviors:**
- **Authenticated Users**: Standard sign out process
- **Anonymous Users**: Account deletion with data loss warning

## Subscription Integration

### Subscription Status Display
- Dynamic icon based on subscription status (crown/leaf)
- Color-coded status badges (PRO/FREE)
- Integration with PurchasesManager for real-time status

### Subscription View
Currently shows placeholder content indicating future implementation:
- Crown icon with bounce animation
- "This feature will be available soon" message
- Prepared for RevenueCat integration

## Display Shelf Feature
