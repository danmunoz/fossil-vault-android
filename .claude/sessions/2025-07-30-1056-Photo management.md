### Todo Summary
**Total Tasks:** 6 tasks
**Completed:** 6/6 ‚úÖ 100%
**Remaining:** 0/6

**Completed Tasks:**
1. ‚úÖ Examine current data models (Specimen, StoredImage) and ViewModel structure
2. ‚úÖ Add camera and gallery permissions to AndroidManifest.xml  
3. ‚úÖ Create image picker utility for camera and gallery selection with multiple image support
4. ‚úÖ Implement PhotoGrid component to display image thumbnails with delete functionality
5. ‚úÖ Update PhotoSection in AddSpecimenScreen with proper image management UI
6. ‚úÖ Fix LazyVerticalGrid infinite height constraint crash and improve scalability

### Key Accomplishments

#### üéØ Primary Feature Implementation
- **Complete Photo Management System** for Add Specimen screen
- **Multi-source Image Selection** (Camera + Gallery)
- **Visual Grid Display** with thumbnails and delete functionality
- **Scalable Architecture** supporting 3-20+ images

#### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Achievements
- **Permission Management** - Proper Android 13+ and legacy permission handling
- **File Provider Setup** - Secure camera image capture with FileProvider
- **Layout Architecture** - Solved complex nested scrolling constraints
- **State Management** - Integrated with existing MVVM architecture

#### üö´ Critical Bug Fix
- **Resolved LazyVerticalGrid Crash** - Replaced with FlowRow layout
- **Infinite Height Constraint Issue** - Fixed nested scrolling container problems
- **Scalability Enhancement** - Future-proofed for 20+ image subscription limits

### Features Implemented

#### üì± Image Selection
- **Camera Capture** with proper file management
- **Gallery Multi-Select** up to configured limit
- **Permission Dialogs** with user-friendly messaging
- **Image Limit Enforcement** (currently 3, configurable to 20+)

#### üñºÔ∏è Visual Display
- **FlowRow Grid Layout** - Responsive, wrapping design
- **Image Thumbnails** - 120dp square with aspect ratio
- **Delete Functionality** - Individual remove buttons per image
- **Add Photos Button** - Shows when under limit
- **Progress Indicator** - "X/Y photos" counter

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Integration
- **ViewModel Integration** - Uses existing `updateImages()` method
- **StoredImage Model** - Leverages existing data structures
- **Material3 Design** - Consistent with app theme
- **Error Handling** - Graceful permission and loading failures

### Problems Encountered & Solutions

#### üêõ Major Issue: Layout Crash
**Problem:** `LazyVerticalGrid` caused crashes due to infinite height constraints when nested inside vertically scrollable `Column`
**Solution:** Replaced with `FlowRow` layout which doesn't have scrolling constraints
**Impact:** Critical fix that prevented app crashes during photo selection

#### üîß Technical Challenges
**Problem:** Scaling from 3 to 20+ images with different layout approaches
**Solution:** `FlowRow` provides perfect scalability without performance issues
**Impact:** Future-proof design ready for subscription features

### Dependencies Added/Removed
- **No new dependencies** - Used existing Coil, Compose, and Activity Result APIs
- **Leveraged existing** - androidx.activity.compose, androidx.core.content.FileProvider

### Configuration Changes

#### AndroidManifest.xml
- Added camera and storage permissions (Android 13+ compatible)
- Added camera hardware feature (not required)
- Added FileProvider for secure camera image capture

#### New Resource Files
- `app/src/main/res/xml/file_paths.xml` - FileProvider path configuration

### Deployment Steps Taken
1. ‚úÖ **Built successfully** - `./gradlew assembleDebug`
2. ‚úÖ **Installed on device** - `./gradlew installDebug` 
3. ‚úÖ **Tested functionality** - Verified crash fix and image selection
4. ‚úÖ **Code quality** - Clean build with only pre-existing lint warnings

### Architecture Decisions

#### Component Structure
- **ImagePickerManager** - Reusable permission and launcher management
- **PhotoGrid** - Scalable image display with FlowRow
- **PhotoSection** - Integration point in AddSpecimenScreen

#### Design Patterns
- **Composition over Inheritance** - Composable utilities
- **Single Responsibility** - Separated concerns across components
- **State Management** - Leveraged existing ViewModel patterns

### Lessons Learned

#### üéì Key Insights
1. **LazyLayouts in Scrollable Containers** - Always check for infinite constraint issues
2. **FlowRow Superiority** - Better than LazyGrid for small, finite datasets
3. **Permission Strategy** - Handle Android 13+ media permissions properly
4. **FileProvider Setup** - Essential for secure camera image capture

#### üîç Development Tips
1. **Build Early, Test Often** - Caught layout crash during device testing
2. **Future-Proof Design** - Considered 20-image scaling from start
3. **Error Handling** - Graceful permission denial and image loading failures

### What Wasn't Completed
- **Image Upload to Firebase Storage** - StoredImage currently uses local URIs
- **Image Compression/Optimization** - Raw image files stored locally
- **Offline Caching Strategy** - No Room database integration for images
- **Bulk Selection UI Enhancement** - Basic multi-select implementation

### Tips for Future Developers

#### üöÄ Next Steps
1. **Implement Firebase Storage Upload** - Convert local URIs to cloud URLs
2. **Add Image Compression** - Optimize file sizes before storage
3. **Subscription Limit Integration** - Connect maxImages to user subscription
4. **Enhanced UX** - Add loading states, better error messages

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- **FlowRow Layout** - Don't revert to LazyVerticalGrid without solving constraints
- **Permission Handling** - Test on Android 13+ devices for media permissions
- **File Provider** - Authority must match applicationId in manifest
- **Image Limits** - Currently hardcoded to 3, easily configurable

#### üîß Code Maintenance
- **ImagePickerManager** - Reusable across app for other image selection needs
- **PhotoGrid** - Scalable component, just adjust maxImages parameter
- **Error States** - Consider adding retry mechanisms for failed image loads

### Final Status
‚úÖ **Photo Management Feature COMPLETE**  
‚úÖ **All Requirements Met**  
‚úÖ **Crash Issues Resolved**  
‚úÖ **Future-Proof Architecture**  
‚úÖ **Ready for Production**
